# Natural_Disaster_Tweet
# Dataset Used
The Kaggle dataset used is NLP Based Tweet Classification

# Basic Introduction 
Twitter has become an important mode of communication in times of emergency.
It has enabled people to be aware and alarm others in real time. As a result of which, more agencies are interested in monitioring Twitter.
But sometimes, the words might not always specify an emergency and in this case a natural disaster. Therefore an NLP model is designed to make sure that the safety teams respond to the tweets that indicate a situation of natural disaster.



# Procedure
The following was the pipeline used for the complete project included the following steps :
> 1. Basic EDA
> 2. Pre-processing
>    * abbreviations fix 
>    * correcting spellings
>    * removing unwanted spaces
>    * remove URLs
> 4. Vectorization (Tf-IDF vectorizer)
> 5. Machine Learning 
>    * Logistic Regression
>    * Decision Tree Classification
>    * XGB Classifier
>    * MLP Classifier
> 6. Deep Learning
>    * Bi-directional LSTM with BatchNormalization
>    * BERT model
